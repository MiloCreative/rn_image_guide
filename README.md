* Valid charset is for naming resources is [a-z, _, 0â€“9] i.e. All small case characters, numbers, and underscore.
* First letter of your asset name can be either _ or a small case character, it cannot be a number.
* Do not use capitals letters not even in extensions like .PNG or .JPG
* Use _ as separator wherever you want to differentiate two words because -(hyphen) and space are not allowed
